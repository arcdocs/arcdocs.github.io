# Requesting a software install on HPC

We have a wide variety of research software installed on ARC3 and ARC4. However, we may not always have the
software you are looking for. In this situation there are a couple of options:

- See if the software is available within the [conda package management system](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo).

- Have a go at building the software from source in your /home or /nobackup directory. Most software usually comes with a README file that includes instructions for installing. You can always contact us for help and advice via our [contact form](https://it.leeds.ac.uk/it?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=7587b2530f675f00a82247ece1050eda).

- If you think this software will be used by a large number of users you can request the software be installed as a Module
on one or both of our systems. You can request a software install using our [install request form](https://it.leeds.ac.uk/it?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=48d5a6d70f275f00a82247ece1050ea0).
