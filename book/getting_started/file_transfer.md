# File Transfer

Moving files onto and off the HPC systems is a crucial part of any researchers workflow and on this page we'll outline a number of approaches for performing file transfer.

```{admonition} Local vs Remote
It's worth noting that while you can access the HPC from your home machine, the
reverse is not true.  This means that you want to run commands on your local
machine to transfer files to and from ARC, rather than attempt to run commands
on the HPC to access your own machine, as this will not work.  This doesn't
apply if you're accessing another service, like OneDrive, or other filestores
on campus.
