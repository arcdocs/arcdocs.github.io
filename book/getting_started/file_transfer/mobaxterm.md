# Using MobaXTerm

Windows users who make use of MobaXTerm can take advantage of some builtin tools for file management. By default when a user connects to ARC through MobaXTerm files are displayed in the left-hand file explorer window (highlighted in red).

 In this file explorer we can see all the folders and files within the directory path specified at the top (in this example `/home/home01/medacola/`), we can change this directory path if we wish to look in a different directory (that we have permission to view).

We can also download files from ARC onto our local computer by selecting them in the file explorer window and pressing the Download icon ![Download icon](../../assets/img/filetransfer/mobaWindow2down50x46.png).

We can upload files and directories using this file explorer by dragging and dropping them into that window.

We can also download files and directories from HPC to our local machine using this drag and drop approach with MobaXTerm, shown below.

This allows us to performance basic file transfer steps using the MobaXTerm GUI. We can also make use of the MobaXTerm terminal to perform command based file transfer as outlined the in next section [Using a Terminal](#Using-a-Terminal).
