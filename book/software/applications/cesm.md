The Community Earth System Model ([CESM](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/)) is a coupled climate model. It has seven different components: atmosphere, ocean, river run off, sea ice, land ice. The Common Infrastructure for Modeling the Earth (CIME) is a python based tool for coupling these different aspects together. The latest release is CESM 2.1.3 using CIME 5.6.
