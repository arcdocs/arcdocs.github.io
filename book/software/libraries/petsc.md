# Petsc

PETSc, the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation, pronounced PET-see (/?p?t-si?/), is a suite of data structures and routines for the scalable (parallel) solution of scientific applications modeled by partial differential equations. It supports MPI, and GPUs through CUDA, HIP or OpenCL, as well as hybrid MPI-GPU parallelism; it also supports the NEC-SX Tsubasa Vector Engine. PETSc (sometimes called PETSc/TAO) also contains the TAO, the Toolkit for Advanced Optimization, software library.
