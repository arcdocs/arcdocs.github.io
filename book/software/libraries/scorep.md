# Scorep

The Score-P measurement infrastructure is a highly scalable and easy-to-use tool suite for profiling, event trace recording, and online analysis of HPC applications. Score-P offers the user a maximum of convenience by supporting a number of analysis tools. Currently, it works with Periscope, Scalasca, Vampir, and Tau and is open for other tools. Score-P comes together with the new Open Trace Format Version 2, the CUBE4 profiling format and the Opari2 instrumenter.
